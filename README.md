# referral_analysis_newborn
This project aims at identifying the referral pathways of new-borns who were born in Mantra facilities, and alive at the time of referral and discharge. In the end, we will be able to understand facilities and individual new-borns who are more likely to be referred. We will also conduct data quality analysis for data quality improvement.
